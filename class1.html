<p>Title of Course: Database Management System
    Course Code: BCA401
    L-T Scheme: 3-1 Course Credits: 3
    Introduction
    Database Management Systems (DBMS) consists of a set of interrelated data and a set of programs to
    access that data. They underpin any computer system and are therefore fundamental to any program of
    study in computer science. An understanding of DBMS is crucial in order to appreciate the limitations of
    data storage and application behavior and to identify why performance problems arise.
    Students who complete this course are expected to develop the ability to design, implement and
    manipulate databases. Students will apply and build databases for various day to day real life scenarios
    and real life applications. The course will by and large be structured but will introduce open-ended data</p>
